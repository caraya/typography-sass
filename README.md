# SASS exercises for typography

A lot of time I find myself writing mixins or SASS code that I think I may want to reuse or I may want to incorporate in a blog post or other type of project. 

Rather than scour hard drives or have to Google where I found it, I thought it better to take some time and code an example of what I thought I may need, store it here and then copy it when/if I need to use it.
